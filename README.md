# Spatial Navigation Simulation using Hippocampome Resources

This software simulates neural activites in rodents that occur during spatial navigation.

## Prerequisites

[CARLsim 6.0 or newer version](https://github.com/UCI-CARL/CARLsim6)
<br>Matlab (originally created with r2022a version)
<br>- This is if users want to use the plotting scripts included.
<br>- Possibly the plotting scripts could be ported to Octave but this has not yet been tried.
<br>C++ compiler
<br>Originally designed on Linux (Ubuntu) but may be run on other OSes
<br>- Included scripts are created for Linux and may need to be adapted for other OSes
